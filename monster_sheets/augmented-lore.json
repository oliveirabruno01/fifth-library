It attacked me without warning, its wicked glaive inflicting a searing pain in my chest. I managed to escape, but not before it whispered in my mind, 'You are mine now. You will suffer and die, and your soul will be mine.'\n\n Father, I am afraid. The wound festers, and I grow weaker each day. Healers and priests can do nothing for me. They say the wound is infernal, curable only by magic. But magic is rare and expensive, and I have no money left. I am alone and helpless.\n\n Father, I beg you, please help me. Please send me some money, or a magic item, or anything that can save me. I don't want to die. I don't want to lose my soul. I don't want to become a devil. Please, father, please.\n\n Your loving son,\n\n Rolan"

The dragon has a particular fondness for gold, and it often spends hours polishing its collection. The lair is also home to a menagerie of creatures, from the mundane to the magical, which the dragon has captured over the years.

Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording.

Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\nWishes.\nThe genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.",

This bond is a double-edged sword, however, as the golem's life is tied to that of its creator. If the creator should fall, the golem's existence may be threatened, and the creature may become uncontrollable, its loyalty to its fallen master driving it to wreak havoc on the world."
